Hello.

My project took on a previous project whose readme file is just below this paragraph.
I was asked to teach a computer to play a game using nerual network I chose game 4 in a row.
The game has already applied the ui and the minmax tree but in my change the game plays with a network of neurons that is always in a learning position instead of a human user.
